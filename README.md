***Reclaim Your Digital Footprint***

### Introduction
In today's digital age, your online presence often extends beyond your conscious control. Every social media post, online purchase, and forum comment contributes to your digital footprint. This invisible trail can be exploited by cybercriminals, leading to identity theft, financial fraud, and reputational damage.

**RansomFree** is here to change that. Our tool is designed to help you reclaim your digital privacy, educate you on ransomware attacks, phishing simulations, and empower you with real-life practicality through hands-on learning.
